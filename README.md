# Advent of Code 2019

Solutions in Ada by James Tomasino.

## Overview

I have little practice with Ada other than repeating web tutorials and basic
book examples. This event gives me the opportunity to build solutions from
scratch in an unfamiliar language. My solutions, therefore, should not be
viewed as a good example of working Ada code even when they solve the problem.
I still have a lot to learn.

## Input processing

So far I have not taken on the task of reading the problem input from a file
and processing it. That is a step I would like to try and solve before the end
of the month, but it is a more advanced topic in Ada for me. Instead I am
formatting the input data into Ada variables in the programs themselves.
